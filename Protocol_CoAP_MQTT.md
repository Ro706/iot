# Basics of Networking Protocols (CoAP, MQTT) and Cloud Platform (ThingSpeak) for IoT Applications

## Aim
Basics of networking protocols (CoAP, MQTT) and cloud platform (ThingSpeak) for IoT applications.

## Material Required
1. Computer with internet access
2. Raspberry Pi or ESP8266 / ESP32 microcontroller
3. MQTT Brokers (e.g., Mosquitto)
4. ThingSpeak account
5. Python programming environment

## Theory

### 1. CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol)
- A lightweight protocol designed for constrained devices.
- Works over UDP and follows a request-response model similar to HTTP.
- Used in IoT applications for efficient communication between devices.

### 2. MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)
- A lightweight messaging protocol that works on a publish-subscribe model.
- Operates over TCP and is ideal for low bandwidth IoT communication.

### 3. MQTT Brokers
- MQTT Brokers (like Mosquitto) manage message exchanges between clients.

### 4. ThingSpeak
- A cloud-based platform for IoT data collection and visualization.
- Allows real-time data monitoring and analytics.
- Supports REST API and MQTT for data communication.

## Procedure
1. Setting up an MQTT Broker.
2. Implementing CoAP communication.
3. Sending data to ThingSpeak.

## Conclusion
Introduces network protocols CoAP and MQTT along with cloud integration using ThingSpeak.
